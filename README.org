* A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Task
** Dataset
We choose California housing Data from \cit{}
The Author took it from 
https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html
and modified it for data exploratory purposes.
It has the following features

20640 instances with 10 features

|----+--------------------+-------------|
|    | Feature            | Data Type   |
|----+--------------------+-------------|
|  1 | Longitude          | Continuous  |
|  2 | Latitude           | Continuous  |
|  3 | Housing Median Age | Continuous  |
|  4 | Total Rooms        | Continuous  |
|  5 | Total Bedrooms     | Continuous  |
|  6 | Population         | Continuous  |
|  7 | Households         | Continuous  |
|  8 | Median Income      | Continuous  |
|  9 | Media House Value  | Continuous  |
| 10 | Ocean Proximity    | Categorical |
